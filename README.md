# StrikeNet: A Comprehensive Cyber Offensive Tool
StrikeNet is a versatile cyber offensive tool that integrates multiple functionalities into a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Designed for both ethical hacking and cybersecurity analysis, it combines the capabilities of several essential tools into a single application, including:
1. Keylogger: Captures keystrokes on a target system to monitor user activity or gather sensitive information.
2. Packet Sniffer: Analyzes network traffic to intercept and examine data packets, helping identify vulnerabilities or monitor communications.
3. Network Scanner: Discovers devices with their IP and MAC address, allowing the user to map the network structure.
4. MAC Changer: Modifies the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a device to anonymize activities or bypass access controls

# Key Features

- **Real-Time Output Display**  
  Each module provides real-time feedback within the GUI, eliminating the need to rely on external files for results and logs.

- **Integrated Control Panel**  
  A centralized interface allows users to start, stop, and configure each module independently, promoting flexibility and ease of use.

- **Lightweight Resource Usage**  
  StrikeNet is optimized for minimal CPU and memory consumption, ensuring smooth performance even on lower-end systems and during extended usage.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  The backend logic is structured modularly, enabling future scalability and customizationâ€”such as adding new tools or enhancements without overhauling the entire application.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Designed for both Linux and Windows environments, StrikeNet ensures broad accessibility for users across different infrastructures.
